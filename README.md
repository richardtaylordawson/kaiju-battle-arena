# Kaiju Battle Arena
> Messaging multiplayer game where players battle their Kaiju in the battle arena.

## Credits
Several projects aided in inspiring this project. Notably they are:

- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

## Things I Learned
Twilio is an amazing communications platform that I wanted to learn more about and this project helped so much in learning their text messaging platform. It was a fun problem figuring out how to make the logic for pairing up two players to battle each other and I hope to finish this project and deploy one day for everyone to enjoy.
